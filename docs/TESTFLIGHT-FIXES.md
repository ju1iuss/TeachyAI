# TestFlight Crash Fixes

This document explains the fixes applied to prevent app crashes on TestFlight.

## Root Issue

The app was crashing on TestFlight launch because of strict environment variable validation. Environment variables accessible in development weren't available in production builds, causing immediate crashes on startup.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Environment Variable Handling

- Modified `app/utils/env.ts` to:
  - Only validate strictly in development
  - Provide fallbacks for missing values in production
  - Never throw errors during initialization

### 2. Supabase Client

- Updated `lib/supabase.ts` to:
  - Create a placeholder client if credentials are missing
  - Add graceful error handling for all operations
  - Prevent crashes on initialization

### 3. App Initialization

- Enhanced `app/_layout.tsx` with:
  - Try/catch blocks around all initialization code
  - A fallback UI if critical components fail to load
  - Nested error boundaries

### 4. Authentication

- Improved `contexts/auth.tsx` to:
  - Handle errors during authentication state changes
  - Provide fallbacks if auth services are unavailable
  - Add robust error logging

### 5. Native Layer Protection

- Enhanced `ios/TeachyAI/AppDelegate.mm` with:
  - Try/catch blocks for app initialization
  - Bundle URL validation
  - User-friendly error alerts instead of crashes

### 6. Async Operations

- Improved `app/utils/asyncHandler.ts` with:
  - Better error handling
  - Support for fallback values
  - Enhanced error context

## Build and Testing

Added new scripts:

- `npm run build:ios:prod` - Builds for TestFlight with pre-checks
- `npm run check:launch` - Analyzes code for potential launch issues
- `npm run deploy:testflight` - Submits builds to TestFlight

## Best Practices

1. **Never throw errors during app initialization**
2. **Always provide fallbacks for potentially missing values**
3. **Wrap critical operations in try/catch blocks**
4. **Log errors for debugging but don't crash the app**
5. **Show user-friendly messages when services are unavailable**

## Testing Before Release

1. Run `npm run check:launch` to verify crash protection
2. Test with no environment variables set
3. Build using the production script
4. Test on a real device through TestFlight

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed crash reporting
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Add connectivity checks and offline mode
